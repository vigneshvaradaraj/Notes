1) start timer at rising edge
2) on falling edge compare the timer counter value 
3) take action depends on the tiemr interval

we can maintain status structure to all the work if it is done or not 
note: if it is done already do not do it again.

Event post:
	1.when posting event mention the state where it should work.
	if the event mentioned state is not a corrent state don't post it.
	This could reduce the function pointer array size because it is reducing NULL initialisation in that array.
	And it reduces unwantedly unblocking the task.
	
	2.Event is a function it might do some action are put the system into different state.
	
	3.These (Guards/entry/exit actions) three Actions shall be executed for each state transision.

By using switch
	We can use first switch for state filtering and second nested switch for event filtering.
